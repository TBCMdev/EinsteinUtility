# **DCU CompSci Addons**

This repo holds script addons for your DCU account.

- Note: *most scripts here wont work from home as 2FA is required. run these cmds on a linux machine in the labs for accurate results.*

## Scripts

### lss.sh - Lab Sheet Setup

Lab Sheet setup is a shell script that automatically creates all files in a specified labsheet, with the necessary shebang.

### tnext.sh - Next Task

Opens your next task (the next task after your last edited file) in your specified editor.
- To specify your editor (nano is used by default), run `tnext -c` and it will setup your config for you. Alternatively, you can edit the config directly at: `~/bin/cmds/tnext/.cfg`

### pgs.sh - Progress

Shows your progress on the labsheet provided.
